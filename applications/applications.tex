\chapter{Applications}
  \label{ch:examples}

  Lots of examples in this chapter highlighting various application areas. Emphasis is on mechanistic applications where the fractional derivative arises from the actual dynamics of the system. This is in contrast to a fractional model with a solution that matches an application, but where a nonlinear model is actually better.
