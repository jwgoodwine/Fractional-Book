\chapter{Fractional-Order Differential Equations}

\begin{example}
  Determine the solution to
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\d^{\frac{1}{2}}x}{\d t^{\frac{1}{2}}}(t) + a x(t) = f(t)
  \end{equation*}
  where we use the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, or
  \begin{equation}
    \tensor*[^{RL}]{\D}{^{\frac{1}{2}}} x(t) + a x(t) = f(t).
    \label{eq:fracdiffeqex1}
  \end{equation}
Computing the Laplace transform of each side of the equation gives
\begin{equation*}
  s^\frac{1}{2} X(s) - \left[ \tensor*[]{\D}{^{-\frac{1}{2}}} x(t) \right]_{t=0} + a X(s) = F(s).
\end{equation*}
For the time being, let us assume that the initial condition term is not zero, and call it $c$. Solving for $X(s)$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  X(s) = \frac{c}{\sqrt{s} + a} + \frac{F(s)}{\sqrt{s} + a}.
\end{equation*}

If $f(t) = 0$ and $c = 1$, then
\begin{equation*}
  X(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}+a}
\end{equation*}
and the Laplace transform table gives that 
\begin{equation*}
  x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \E_{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}}\left( a \sqrt{t} \right). 
\end{equation*}
The solution to this equation is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fracdiffeqex1a}. Note for increasing $a$ the solution decays more rapidly. A graph of $x(t) = \e^{-2 t}$ is also shown for comparison.

  \label{fig:fracdiffeqex1a}
\end{figure}

Now, assume that $f(t) = 1$, so that $F(s) = 1/s$, in which case
\begin{equation}
  X(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s} + a} + \frac{1}{s \left( \sqrt{s} + a \right)}.
\end{equation}
From Table~\ref{tab:ltpairs}, for the second term, we need that $\alpha = 1/2$ and in order to get the other $s$ term in the denominator, we need $\beta - \alpha = 1$, so $\beta = 3/2$, which gives
\begin{equation*}
  x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \E_{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}} \left( a \sqrt{t} \right) + \sqrt{t} \E_{\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}} \left( a \sqrt{t} \right).
\end{equation*}

Figure~\ref{fig:fracdiffeqex1b} illustrates the solutions when $c=0$, \ie, it is the``step response'' portion of the solution. Figure~\ref{fig:fracdiffeqex1c} illustrates the full solution including the term with $c=1$.

\begin{example}
  As a second example, consider a mass attached to a wall and subjected to a force as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:masswall}. We will consider the attachment to the wall as having some sort of mechanical impendence, which could be a spring, or a damper or perhaps a fractional-order type network such as the $1/2$-order tree network of springs and dampers considered earlier in Section~\ref{sec:introexamples}. The top part of the figure illustrates the half-order connection, and the bottom part represents the more general situation where the order of the relationship between the force resisting the motion and the displacement is of order $\alpha$.

    \label{fig:masswall}
  \end{figure}

  Newton's law on the mass gives
  \begin{equation*}
    m \frac{\d^2 x}{\d t^2}(t) + q \frac{\d^\alpha x}{\d t^\alpha}(t) = f(t).
  \end{equation*}a
  In the case where the connection is a spring, we would use $q = k$ and $\alpha = 0$, and when it is a damper, we would use $q = b$ and $\alpha = 1$. Divide both sides by $m$, let $f(t)$ be a unit step input, assume zero initial conditions of all orders and take the Laplace transform of both sides, which gives
  \begin{equation*}
    X(s) = \frac{1}{s \left(s^2 + \frac{q}{m} s^\alpha \right)} = \frac{1}{s^{\alpha + 1} \left( s^{2 - \alpha} + \frac{q}{m} \right) }.
  \end{equation*}
