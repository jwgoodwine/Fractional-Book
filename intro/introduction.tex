\section{Reasons to Study Fractional Calculus}
Some people may study fractional calculus because it is inherently interesting to them. Other people need more or different reasons. A few reasons include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fractional calculus expands the descriptive power of calculus beyond the familiar integer order derivatives and the basic concept of rate of change. This will yield more accurate descriptive equations when a system truly is fractional.
  \item Fractional calculus can expand scientific understanding when it models things that are traditionally very difficult to describe mathematically.
  \item Integer order derivatives are \emph{local} needing information only in a neighborhood of a point. As will be seen, fractional derivatives are \emph{non-local} and can describe systems with such a feature. For example, the equation $F=ma$ holds instantaneously. How something accelerates only depends on the forces right now, not the forces at any time in the past. For systems with ``memory'' effects, or analogous non-local spatial effects, the differential equation describing it most accurately may be fractional.
\end{itemize}

It is not surprising that ``normal'' integer-order calculus works well for most engineering applications over the past few centuries. Newton, who was one of the very early developers of calculus, clearly had a strong interest in mechanics \cite{principia}. However, there are engineering topics of modern interest for which fractional calculus may be important (and correspondingly, integer-order calculus insufficient). One area is bioengineering, where traditional mechanics and electromagnetism do not fully describe the system and in which non-local time effects may occur. Another is very large scale systems that may be easier to consider as having an infinite number of components, rather than keeping track of every single part. Examples of each type are given in this chapter.  Finally, fractional calculus has been used as a new tool to try to match measured responses to ``generally hard to model'' system, \textit{e.g.}, systems with friction, stiction, etc. 

\section{Introductory Concepts}
Anyone reading this book should be familiar with the notion of the first, second and higher derivatives, \textit{e.g.}, for $f(t) = t^3 + 5 t^2 + 2$, 
\begin{align}
  \frac{\d f}{\d t}(t) &= 3 t^2 + 10 t \\
  \frac{\d^2 f}{\d t^2}(t) &= 6t + 10, 
  \label{eq:derivs}
\end{align}
\textit{etc.} Also we naturally think of integrals in an antiderivative sense, \textit{e.g.},
\begin{align}
  \int f(t) \d t &= \frac{1}{4} t^4 + \frac{5}{3} t^3 + 5 t^2 + c 
  \label{eq:integrals}
\end{align}
and we adopt a notation of $f^{(1)}(t)$ as the first derivative, $f^{(2)}(t)$ as the second derivative and $f^{(n)}(t)$ as the $n$th derivative as well as $f^{(-1)}(t)$ as $f$ integrated one time, $f^{(-2)}$ as $f$ integrated two times, \textit{etc.}

A mathematically curious reader may already be wondering if there are any derivatives ``in between'' the integer ones.
For example, is there a one-half derivative:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\d^\frac{1}{2} f}{\d t^\frac{1}{2}}(t) = f^{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = ?
  \label{eq:halfderiv}
\end{equation}
There is not an immediate obvious answer to this because of the fact that the integer order derivative (as is the integral) is defined as a limit
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\d f}{\d t}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} = \frac{f\left(t + \Delta t \right) - f\left(t\right)}{\Delta t}
  \label{eq:limdef}
\end{equation}
and that is a discrete operation. There is not a natural half way to do it.

Basically we want to generalize the notion of the derivative. In a sense, if we define something to give the, say $\alpha$ derivative where $\alpha \in \mathbb R$, \textit{i.e.}, $\alpha$ is a real number, then all we really need is that when $\alpha$ is an integer we get the usual definition of that integer order derivative. In between there may be lots of different options (there are!), but it makes sense to set some other basic requirements we want a fractional-order derivative to satisfy.

\begin{example}
  Consider $f(t) = t^2$ with the first and second derivatives $f^{(1)}(t) = 2 t$ and $f^{(2)}(t) = 2$, respectively. We should expect that the $1/2$ derivative is, in some qualitative sense, ``between'' $f(t)$ and $f^{(1)}(t)$, and that the $3/2$ derivative is ``between'' the first and second derivatives, as is illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:fracidea1} and \ref{fig:fracidea2}.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{fracidea}
    \caption{The zeroth and first derivatives of $f(t)=t^2$, (blue and red curves). A prospective half derivative (gold).}
    \label{fig:fracidea1}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{fracidea2}
    \caption{The first and second derivatives of $f(t)=t^2$ (blue and red curves) with a prospective $3/2$ derivative (gold).}
    \label{fig:fracidea2}
  \end{figure}

  We also expect that as we vary the order of the derivative, say from $0$ to $1$, for low values of the order the result is near the zeroth derivative, and for values of the fractional order near one, it is near the first derivative. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fracidea3}.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{fracidea3}
    \caption{The function (blue) and the first derivative (red). The $0.2$, $0.4$, $0.6$ and $0.8$th (yellow, purple, green, light blue) order derivatives ``move'' from the zeroth derivative to the first derivative.}
    \label{fig:fracidea3}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}

This example motivates our first desirable attribute of a fractional derivative.

\begin{attribute}
  For a fractional derivative, $f^{\left( \alpha \right)}(t)$, if $\alpha$ is near an integer value, we expect the $\alpha$ derivative to be near that integer derivative of $f(t)$. As $\alpha$ varies between integer values, we expect that $f^{\left( \alpha \right)}(t)$ varies in a reasonable manner between those integer values.
\end{attribute}

\section{Fractional Derivatives of some Elementary Functions}
\subsection{Sine and Cosine Functions}
As a first step into some real functions, we consider sine and cosine.

\begin{example}
  Consider $f(t) = \sin(t)$. The nice thing about sines and cosines are their relatively simple derivatives. In fact, from the pattern
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\d}{\d t} \sin(t) &= \cos(t) \\
    \frac{\d^2}{\d t^2} \sin(t) &= -\sin(t)
  \end{align*}
  as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fracidea4}, it is clear that the derivative for this function just shifts it to the left by $\pi/2$. So clearly we would expect that the $1/2$ derivative just shifts it to the left by $\pi/4$, or the $1/3$ integral shifts it right by $\pi/6$, \textit{etc}. Therefore, a reasonable guess for the half derivative would be as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fracidea5}.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{fracidea4}
    \caption{First (red) and second (gold) derivative of $\sin(t)$ (blue). The arrows indicate that derivative is just shifts the curve to the left by $\pi/2$ for each derivative.}
    \label{fig:fracidea4}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{fracidea5}
  \caption{Reasonable assumption for the half derivative (red) of $\sin9t)$ (blue).}
  \label{fig:fracidea5}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

\subsection{Monomials and Polynomials}

Being able to take the fractional derivative of sine and cosine functions is nice, but we would like to do more. Another relatively simple class of functions is polynomials. Consider 
\begin{equation}
  f(t) = t^k
  \label{eq:poly}
\end{equation}
which is easy to differentiate a few times and figure out the pattern:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\d f}{\d t}(t) &= k t^{k-1} \\
  \frac{\d^2 f}{\d t^2}(t) &= k \left( k-1 \right) t^{k-2} \\
  \frac{\d^3 f}{\d t^3}(t) &= k \left( k-1 \right) \left( k - 2 \right) t^{k-3} \\
  \vdots &= \vdots \\
  \frac{\d^n f}{\d t^n}(t) &= \frac{k!}{\left( k - n \right)!} t^{k-n}, \qquad n \leq k.
  \label{eq:polyderivs}
\end{align}
Since we are looking to define a fractional derivative of $t^k$, we need to see what is allowed and not allowed for $n$ to take on fractional values in Equation~\ref{eq:polyderivs}. The exponent of $t$ can be a fraction, so that is not a problem.\footnote{This is actually a very important point that we will consider in detail in Section~\ref{sec:indices}. For now, as engineers, we will accept as a given the commonly used operation that an exponent can be a fraction.} What is definitely a problem, though, is the factorial in the denominator: if $k$ is a natural number and $n$ is not an integer, then the factorial is not defined.

The factorial function is just a series of values, so it seems we can generalize the derivative of $t^k$ if we can find a curve through the factorial values. In fact, of course, it has been done and it is the gamma function defined by
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma\left(z\right) = \int_0^\infty x^{z - 1} e^{-x} \d x
  \label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
which is plotted for positive real values of $z$ in Figure~\ref{fig:gamma}. Clearly, for integer values
\begin{equation}
  z! = \Gamma\left( z + 1 \right).
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subimport{figs/}{gamma}
  \caption{Plot of $\Gamma(z)$ (blue curve) and some factorials, $\left(z - 1\right)!$ (red).}
  \label{fig:gamma}
\end{figure}

So, returning to Equation~\ref{eq:polyderivs}, it seems that all we need to do to define a fractional derivative is to replace the factorial in the denominator with the gamma function shifted by one. Purely for aesthetics, we might as well use a gamma function in the numerator as well, which also then would allow for a fractional $k$. So, we have the following seemingly legitimate definition of a fractional derivative for a monomial.

\begin{definition}
  For the monomial, $t^k$, $k \in \mathbb R$, define a\footnote{This is \emph{a} fractional derivative, rather than \emph{the} fractional derivative because there are many definitions. } proposed fractional derivative 
  \begin{equation}
    \boxed{
    \frac{\d^\alpha}{\d t^\alpha} t^k = \frac{\Gamma\left( k + 1 \right)}{\Gamma \left( k + 1 - \alpha \right)} t^{k - \alpha} }
    \label{eq:monomialfrac}
  \end{equation}
  for real values of $\alpha$, \textit{i.e.}, $\alpha \in \mathbb R$.
  \label{def:monomialfracderiv}
\end{definition}

This definition was used to make the fractional derivative curves in Figures~\ref{fig:fracidea1} through
\ref{fig:fracidea3}, so in a sense it has been validated. Also, because everything we have done is linear in $t$, we can
use this definition for monomials and extend it term-by-term to polynomials. 

For fun, we will do an example with a different $k$ and also include negative values for $\alpha$ to see if integral-like ideas appear.

\begin{example}
  Consider $f(t) = t^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{t}$. Various fractional order derivatives and integrals computed using Equation~\ref{eq:monomialfrac} in Definition~\ref{def:monomialfracderiv} are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:monex}.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subimport{figs/}{monex}
    \caption{Various fractional derivatives using Definition~\ref{def:monomialfracderiv} for $f(t) = \sqrt{t}$. The thick blue curve is the function, or zeroth derivative. The red curve is the $\alpha = -1$ derivative, which does correspond to the integral. The gold curve is the $\alpha = -1/2$ derivative, or the $1/2$ integral. The green and light blue curves are the $1/2$ and first derivatives, respectively.} 
    \label{fig:monex}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}


\subsection{Exponentials}
Since
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\d^n}{\d t^n}e^t = e^t
\end{equation*}
we would like it to also hold for when $n$ is not an integer.  Similarly, 
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\d^n}{\d t^n} e^{\alpha t} = \alpha^n e^{\alpha t}
\end{equation*}
we can require that the same, or something close to this, be true when $n$ is not an integer.

At this point we can compute things we consider to be fractional derivatives and integrals of sines and cosines, monomials, by extension from monomials, polynomials if we do them term-by-term and exponentials.  Before we generalize further, in order to develop a very important property of the fractional derivatives, we need to review some very basic mathematics and consider fractional exponents.


\section{The Law of Indices}
\label{sec:indices}
Engineers deal with fractional and negative exponents so often that it is easy to lose track of why they actually make sense. The exponent is defined for natural numbers (integers greater than zero) as the number of times the base is multiplied by itself, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{equation}
  t^n = \underbrace{t \times t \times t \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$n$ times}}.
  \label{eq:power}
\end{equation}
An obvious property of this is that for two natural number exponents
\begin{align}
  \left(t^n\right) \times \left( t^m \right) &=  \left( \underbrace{t \times t \times t \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$n$ times}}
  \right) \times \left( \underbrace{t \times t \times t \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$m$ times}}
  \right) \\
  &= 
  \underbrace{t \times t \times t \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$n + m$ times}} \\
  &= t^{n + m}
  \label{eq:indices}
\end{align}
which also immediately leads to
\begin{equation}
  \left( t^n \right)^p = t^{n \times p}.
  \label{eq:indices2}
\end{equation}
This notion of adding indices can be used to \emph{define} negative and fractional exponents by requiring that Equations~\ref{eq:indices} and \ref{eq:indices2} hold for all rational values as well (negative values, zero and fractional values). 

For negatives values, consider $n$ and $m$ to be positive integers with $n > m$, and if we require that $\left( t^n \right) \times \left( t^{-m} \right) = t^{n-m}$, then the only way for the $-m$ to take away powers is for it to mean division, 
\begin{equation}
  t^n \times t^{-m} = \frac{\overbrace{t \times t \times t \cdots t \times t}^{\mbox{$n$ times}}}{\underbrace{t \times t \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$m$ times}}} = \underbrace{t \times t  \cdots t \times t}_{\mbox{$n-m$ times}}.
  \label{eq:indices3}
\end{equation}

For fractional values Equation we can use Equation~\ref{eq:indices2} so that
\begin{equation}
  t^\frac{n}{m} = y \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad \left( t^\frac{n}{m} \right)^m = y^m \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad t^n = y^m
\end{equation}
which gives the meaning that if $y = t^{n/m}$, then $y$ is the number that if you raise it to the $m$th power gives $t$ to the $n$th power, \eg, in the simple case of $1/2$, $y$ is the number that if you square you get $t$.

These exercises in indices are important, because they hold for integer order derivatives
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:derivindex}
  \frac{\d^n}{\d t^n} \left( \frac{\d^m}{\d t^m} f(t) \right) = \frac{\d^{n+m} f}{\d t^{n+m}}(t), \quad m,n > 0.
\end{equation}
By insisting that the same property hold when $n$ and $m$ are fractional, will help in generalizing the derivative to non-integer values for a larger class of functions that simple sines, cosines and polynomials. In fact, we may as well call it an attribute. 

\begin{attribute}
  For real values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\d^\alpha}{\d t^\alpha} \left( \frac{\d^\beta}{\d t^\beta} f(t) \right) = \frac{\d^{\alpha + \beta}}{\d t^{\alpha + \beta}}f(t).
    \label{eq:derivindices}
  \end{equation}
\end{attribute}

Even in integer order calculus, integration and differentiation are not exactly inverses because an indefinite integral will have a constant of integration. In other words, if we take $f(t)$ and differentiate it and then integrate it, we get $f(t) + c$, but if we integrate and then differentiate, we get $f(t)$. The idea is clear enough, but it turns out that this complication does affect things, and, in fact, is a key difference between two of the most common definitions of fractional derivatives. 


\section{Examples}

This section contains two examples where fractional-order dynamics naturally appear. They are motivational examples, and many more detailed and more complicated examples appear subsequently in Chapter~\ref{ch:examples}. 
\subsection{Mechanical System and Frequency Domain Example}
\label{sec:introexamples}

Laplace transforms in the fractional calculus context will be developed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:laplace}. Here we provide a very quick review. Multiplication by $s$ in the frequency domain corresponds to differentiation by $t$ in the time domain if we use the
usual variables in the Laplace transform
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} \left\{ f(t) \right\} = \int_{0^-}^\infty f(t) e^{-s t} \d t = F(s),
\end{equation}
\ie
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L \left\{ \frac{\d f}{\d t}(t) \right\} = s F(s) - f(0)
\end{equation}
or assuming zero initial conditions
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L \left\{ \frac{\d f}{\d t}(t) \right\} = s F(s).
\end{equation}
Higher derivatives are just increased exponents on the $s$, \textit{e.g.}, 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L \left\{ \frac{\d^n f}{\d t^n}(t) \right\} = s^n F(s)
\end{equation}
again assuming zero initial conditions.

Of course, the half derivative then would correspond to $s$ raised to the one-half power:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L \left\{ \frac{\d^\frac{1}{2} f}{\d t^\frac{1}{2}}(t) \right\} = s^\frac{1}{2} F(s).
\end{equation}

It turns out that fractional-order transfer functions can arise rather easily in two types of cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item systems with an infinite number of components, and
  \item systems with non-local interactions.
\end{enumerate}
The following example illustrates the first case. Non-locality will be inherent in the more general definitions of fractional derivatives we develop subsequently, so examples will be deferred until later.

\begin{example}
  Consider the tree network of springs and dampers illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:structure}. The position of the left-most node is $x_1(t)$. Assume that all the nodes on the far right are in the same position, \ie, they are somehow fixed together, so in effect they can be considered as one node, and its position will be denoted by $x_{last}(t)$. Assume the nodes have no mass.  In order to compress or extend the network, a force must be exerted on one end, and an an equal and opposite force on the other, $f(t)$. 

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \psfrag{k}{$k$}
    \psfrag{b}{$b$}
    \psfrag{pin}{}
    \psfrag{pout}{}
    \psfrag{x1}{$x_1$}
    \psfrag{xl}{$x_{last}$}
    \psfrag{f(t)}{$f(t)$}
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/structure}
    \caption{Infinite tree of springs and dampers.}
    \label{fig:structure}
  \end{figure}

  The goal is to determine the transfer function relating the force applied to the network to its displacement, \ie,
\begin{equation}
  G(s) = \frac{X_{last}(s) - X_1(s)}{F(s)}.
  \label{eq:xfer}
\end{equation}
If we assume the network is so large that it can be considered infinite\footnote{See \cite{mayes}, which shows that this is a good approximation after approximately seven generations.} then we can consider the network as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:selfsimilar}. In this model, the spring element in the first generation has the transfer function $G_1(s) = 1/k$ and the damper on the bottom in the first generation has the transfer function $G_2(s) = 1/(b s)$.  

The key aspect of this infinite network is that it is \emph{self-similar} in that the overall transfer function relating the force on the network to its displacement is equal to the transfer function from \emph{any} node to $X_{last}$, because from any node to the end there will be an infinite tree of springs and dampers. So if we write the overall transfer function as
\begin{equation}
  G_\infty(s) = \frac{X_{last}(s) - X_1(s)}{F(s)}
\end{equation}
then the transfer for the sub-networks in the red and blue boxes in Figure~\ref{fig:selfsimilar} will also be $G_\infty(s)$. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\psfrag{g1}{$\scriptstyle{G_1(s)}$}
  \psfrag{g2}{$\scriptstyle{G_2(s)}$}
    \psfrag{g}{$\scriptstyle{G_\infty(s)}$}
  \psfrag{x1}{$x_1$}
  \psfrag{xl}{$x_{last}$}
  \psfrag{f(t)}{$f(t)$}
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/structure2}
  \caption{Self-similar network where the transfer function from the beginning to end of each outlined region must be equal.}
  \label{fig:selfsimilar}
\end{figure}

Because the spring and $G_\infty(s)$ are in series along the top of the network, the transfer function along the top will be $G_1(s) + G_\infty(s) = 1/k + G_\infty(s)$ and similarly along the bottom the transfer function will be $G_2(s) + G_\infty(s) = 1/(bs) + G_\infty(s)$. Then, the overall transfer function is these two in parallel, which requires
\begin{equation*}
  G_\infty(s) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{k} + G_\infty(s)} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{bs} + G_\infty(s)}},
\end{equation*}
or, solving for $G_\infty(s)$ gives
\begin{equation}
  G_\infty(s) = \sqrt{G_1(s) G_2(s)} =\sqrt{\frac{1}{k b s }} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{kb}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}.
  \label{eq:tferhalf}
\end{equation}

The square root of $s$ in the transfer function is suggestive of half-order dynamics. Note that a frequency response plot for the transfer function in Equation~\ref{eq:tferhalf} would have a constant phase of $-45^\circ$ and a magnitude plot in decibels with a slope of $-10$ dB/decade.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figs/bodeelement}
  \caption{Network stress-strain frequency response.}
  \label{fig:bodeelement}
\end{figure}

Consistent with the idea above about fractional order systems ``converging'' to integer order ones, we plot the Bode plot for a network of this type where there are five generations with $k =1$ and The Bode plot for this system is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bodeelement}, which is characterized by two half-order dynamics features. First, the slope of the high frequency portion of the magnitude plot is $-10$dB/decade and the phase is $-45^\circ$. Because first order terms are characterized by a slope of $-20$dB/decade and a phase of $-90^\circ$, these features make sense as half order effects.
\end{example}

\subsection{Ultrasound Example}

Bioengineering is a relatively new engineering research area where fractional-order dynamics may be important. Ultrasound wave propagation through animal tissue is an application for which ``normal'' integer-order mechanics seems inadequate to describe \cite{holm}. In this example, we will follow the development in \cite{holm}, but with the simplification of reducing the problem to one dimension.

The viscous wave equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 u + \tau_d \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2},
\end{equation}
which, in one dimension is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \tau_d \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial t \partial x^2} =  \frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}.
\label{eq:1dultra}
\end{equation}
where $u(x,t)$ represents the compressional or shear displacement. The usual interpretation of the damping coefficient, $\tau_d$ is that it is the ratio of viscosity and elasticity. For the one-dimensional problem, $\tau_d$ is the coefficient of the term that is the time rate of change of the curvature of $u(x,t)$. Such a term makes sense for modeling animal tissue because it is composed of both solid (elastic) and liquid (viscous) components.

Normally this author would solve this equation using separation of variables, which leads to a series solution and is easily interpreted as a combination of \emph{modes}. However, in the current context we are interested in the rate at which the signal is attenuated as it propagates through tissue, and as such we will consider the d'Alembert solution which focuses on traveling waves. Note that if $\tau_d=0$, then \emph{any} function of the form $u(x,t) = u(x + c t)$ satisfies the

%We can easily solve Equation~\ref{eq:1dultra} using separation of variables. Assume $u(x,t) = X(x) T(t)$. Substituting into Equation~\ref{eq:1dultra} gives
%\[
%X^{\prime \prime}(x) T(t) + \tau_d X^{\prime \prime}(x) T^{\prime}(t) = \frac{1}{c_0^2} X(x) T^{\prime \prime}(t)
%\]
%and rearranging gives
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{X^{\prime \prime}(x)}{X(x)} = \frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{T^{\prime \prime}(t)}{T(t) + \tau_d T^{\prime}(t)}.
%\label{eq:separated}
%\end{equation}
%Because the left side of Equation~\ref{eq:separated} is a function of only $x$ and the right side is a function of only $t$, the only way they can be equal is for both sides to be constant. As such,
%\[
%\frac{X^{\prime \prime}(x)}{X(x)} = -\lambda,
%\]
%where $\lambda$ is a constant. Assuming homogeneous boundary conditions, $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$ requires $X(0) = X(L) = 0$ requires $\lambda = \left( n \pi/L \right)^2$, and hence
%\begin{equation}
%X(x) = a_n \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots.
%\end{equation}
%
%Using this $\lambda$ value for the $T(t)$ equation gives
%\[
% \frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{T^{\prime \prime}(t)}{T(t) + \tau_d T^{\prime}(t)} = \left( \frac{n \pi}{L} \right)^2
% \]
% or
% \[
% T^{\prime \prime}(t) + c_0^2 \tau_d \left(\frac{n \pi}{L}\right)^2 T'(t) +  c_0^2 \left(\frac{n \pi}{L}\right)^2 T(t) = 0, \quad n=1,2,3,\ldots.
%\]
%
%This is a constant coefficient, linear, ordinary, second-order, homogeneous differential equation and thus is easy to solve. Specifically
%\[
%T_n(t) = \e^{-\zeta \omega_n t} \left[ b_n \sin \left( \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2} \omega_n t \right) + c_n \cos \left( \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2} \omega_n t \right) \right]
%\]
%where
%\[
%\omega_n = \frac{c_0 n \pi}{L}
%\]
%and
%\[
%\zeta = \frac{c_0 \tau_d n \pi}{2 L}.
%\]
%
%Note that the damping ratio increases with $n$, which means the \emph{higher modes are dissapated more quickly than the lower modes.} For an ultrasound signal, then, waves that propagate and are reflected by deeper tissue will have increased attenuation of the higher frequency content in the signal.
